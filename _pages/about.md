Hello! I’m Joseph, a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. From an early age, I’ve been fascinated by how software and systems work, driving me to explore programming, development, and innovation. 

My goal is to create efficient, impactful solutions while continuously learning in this fast-evolving field.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio—let’s connect and build the future of tech together!.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
